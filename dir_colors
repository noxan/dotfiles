# Maintainer: Magnus Woldrich <m@japh.se>
#        URL: https://github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS

#
#   This is a collection of extension:color mappings, suitable to use as your
#   LS_COLORS environment variable. Most of them use the extended color map,
#   described in the ECMA-48 document; in other words, you'll need a terminal
#   with capabilities of displaying 256 colors.
#
#   As of this writing, around 300 different filetypes/extensions is supported.
#   That's indeed a lot of extensions, but there's a lot more! Therefore I need
#   your help.
#
#   Fork this project on github, add the extensions you are missing, and send me
#   a pull request.
#
#   For files that usually ends up next to each other, like html, css and js,
#   try to pick colors that fit nicely together. Filetypes with multiple
#   possible extensions, like htm and html, should have the same color.
#
#   To install and use this file, put something like this is your shell resource
#   file:
#
#     eval $( dircolors -b $HOME/.LS_COLORS)
#
#   where .LS_COLORS is this file.
